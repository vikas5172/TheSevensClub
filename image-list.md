## Implementation Guide

1. **Download Instructions:**
   - Right-click each image link → "Save image as..." → Save to your `/images` folder
   - For premium images requiring download from sites like Freepik, create a free account
   - Resize all images to recommended dimensions before adding to your site

2. **Image Optimization:**
   - Use tools like TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com/) to compress images
   - Aim for file sizes under 200KB for better page loading speed
   - Save service and case study images in WEBP format if possible

3. **Implementation in HTML:**
   - Ensure all `<img>` tags have proper alt text for accessibility 
   - Add loading="lazy" attribute to images below the fold:
     ```html
     <img src="images/team-marketing.jpg" alt="Marketing Lead" loading="lazy">
     ```

4. **Special Effects for Glass Morphism:**
   - For an enhanced glass effect, use semi-transparent images
   - Add this CSS for image hover effects:
   ```css
   .service-image img:hover, .case-study-image img:hover {
     filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(1.1);
     transform: scale(1.05) translateY(-5px);
     box-shadow: 0 15px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
   }
   ```
